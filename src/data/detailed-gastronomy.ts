      text: `Another wonderful evening at my favorite local home! It is unpleasantly cold out; however, this did not stop me from heading out to Mexico in the heart of Saint-Lambert. Despite this, it was packed and the staff were on top of their game (as usual). The quesadillas were on point and the sopa tortilla... oh ♥️! I thank you all for such an amazing experience each time and thank you for offering me a glass of wine. So sweet! I am humbled. 🖤`,
